      <h3>Objective</h3>
      <p>
        Develop a low-latency, privacy-preserving voice assistant on an Arm-based SBC (e.g., Raspberry Pi) that
        processes Hindi voice commands entirely offline. The assistant should handle local queries (time, weather, etc.)
        using on-device ASR and TTS.

    <div class="ch-acc-body">
      <h3>Objective</h3>
      <p>
        Create a touchless HCI system using an NVIDIA Jetson Nano that translates real-time hand gestures into media

      <p>
        This project focuses on accelerating edge AI workloads on embedded platforms using hardware/software co-design.
